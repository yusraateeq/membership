== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Knit Pay free? Do you charge integration fees? =

Knit Pay is a freemium plugin. We are trying our best to provide support for all the payment gateways and plugins free of cost. There are some payment gateways and some plugins for which we collect nominal fees for the integration.

= Do you charge transaction fees? =

In most of the payment gateways, we don't charge you for any transaction fees. You will pay transaction fees to payment gateway companies directly. However, there are a few gateways (like Stripe Connect) in which a fees will be added above payment gateway transaction fees. In such cases, it will be mentioned on the configuration page.

= I want to use a payment gateway but it is missing in Knit Pay, What should I do? =

We are trying to partner with as many payment gateways as possible and adding support for them. You can contact us on WhatsApp if you need support for any payment gateway which is presently not supported. We will try our best to add that gateway.

== Support ==

1. For any issue with the plugin, or if you need help with setup/integration, call/WhatsApp me at +91-7738-4568-13.
2. For any issue with the Payment Gateway account, kindly contact the respective support team.

== Installation ==

https://youtu.be/vWxSqhSVCQE?t=133

= Requirements =

The Knit Pay plugin extends WordPress extensions with payment methods such as Credit Cards, Debit Cards, NetBanking, Wallets, EMI, UPI. To offer the payment methods to the visitors of your WordPress website you also require one of the supported WordPress Plugin.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Knit Pay, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type, “Knit Pay“ and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now“.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Credits ==
