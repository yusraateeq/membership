> _"Recommended to anyone from beginner to experienced coders. I tried MemberMouse and MemberPress and they both lacked critical features that I wanted for my member site. PMPro has all the features I need (Social Login, ability to gift, multiple membership levels, works with BuddyPress) and more. I can easily customize to make it look great too. If I have questions, which is often since I am a beginner in WordPress and know nothing about coding, they are quick to respond and always find a way for me to do exactly what I want. Super happy. Would recommend to anyone from beginner to experienced coders!"_

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need to know any coding to use this plugin? =
No, Paid Memberships Pro does not require any coding knowledge. The plugin is designed to meet all levels of WordPress experience. At the same time, our plugin is very developer-friendly and extendible.

= Does the Paid Memberships Pro work with any WordPress theme? =
Yes. PMPro will work with any properly coded theme. However, some themes may cause conflicts with the plugin. If you find a styling issue with your theme please create a post in the community forum.

= Does the plugin work with caching plugins? =
Absolutely. We have a [complete guide on using a caching plugin](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/documentation/advanced/caching/) or your host's caching methods with Paid Memberships Pro on our website if you want to explore this topic more.

= Does PMPro restrict access to wp-login.php when the plugin is active? =
PMPro does not restrict access to the wp-login.php page when active. This allows your administrator users to leverage advanced security plugins, like Two-Factor and more, so that you can keep your membership site secure. We do include a frontend login page for your members to use for logging in and resetting their password.

= Is Paid Memberships Pro Multisite or Network Compatible? =
"Supporting multisite" means different things to different people. [This guide covers the three primary ways](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/membership-website-wordpress-multisite/) you can use Paid Memberships Pro in a network.

Out of the box PMPro will basically act as a stand alone plugin for each site. Each site has its own list of membership levels, members, payment settings, etc.

Our [Member Network Sites Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-network-multisite-membership/) allows members to choose a site name and title at checkout and will set up a network site at checkout.

Our [Multisite Membership Add On](https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/add-ons/pmpro-network-membership/) allows you to manage memberships at the 'Main' Network site and provide or restrict access on other Network Subsites.
